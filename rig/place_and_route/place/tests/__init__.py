'A selection of placement algorithms.\n\nThis module should contain a selection of placement algorithms, each located in\ntheir own submodule and be named `place`. See the documentation for the parent\n(`par`) module for the standard interface exposed by all placers.\n\nNote to placer developers\n-------------------------\n* A modest suite of generic placement tests can be found in\n  `tests/par/place/test_generic.py`. You should add your placer to the list of\n  placers to be tested at the top of this file to reap the benefits of these\n  basic "sanity check" tests.\n* A number of utility functions which may be useful within a placer\n  implementation can be found in\n  :py:class:`~.rig.place_and_route.place.common`.\n'
