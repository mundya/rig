Tutorial: From 'hello world' to a full application
==================================================

In this tutorial we'll walk through the process of building a SpiNNaker
application using the Rig library. This series of tutorials builds up from
'hello world' to eventually building full-blown digital circuit simulator. This
tutorial is aimed at people who wish to build applications for SpiNNaker and
gives a broad overview of how a SpiNNaker application might be structured and
how Rig can be used to handle the boring details of interacting with and using
a SpiNNaker machine.

.. note::

    This tutorial presumes you are moderately familliar with Python and C and
    have some basic familiarity with the 'Spin1 API' and SARK libraries used to
    write software which runs on SpiNNaker itself.
